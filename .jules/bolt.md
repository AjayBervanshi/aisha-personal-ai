## 2024-05-18 - [Batch Updates to Avoid N+1 Problem with Supabase]
**Learning:** O(N^2) memory analysis loops (like cosine similarity computations) with individual synchronous database updates for each match result in severe network IO overhead and N+1 query patterns. Supabase has PostgREST URL length limits, meaning batched `.in_()` statements should chunk requests.
**Action:** Always accumulate entity IDs inside loops and apply updates in batches outside the loop using `.in_()` (chunked at max 100 items) to prevent blocking the main thread and ensure scalability over time.
## 2024-04-09 - [Supabase Count Optimizations]
**Learning:** By default, calling `select("id", count="exact")` in Supabase without a limit fetches all matching rows into memory/network before returning the exact count. This is an O(N) operation and causes bottlenecks for large tables.
**Action:** Always append `.limit(1)` when doing exact count queries (e.g., `sb.table('table').select('id', count='exact').limit(1).execute()`) to only return the count metadata and max 1 row, avoiding massive memory overhead.
## 2024-05-18 - [GoalEngine Evening Review Update Batching]
**Learning:** `GoalEngine.evening_review` had an N+1 query vulnerability because it iterated through completed daily action IDs and performed a separate `self.supabase.table("aisha_daily_actions").update(...).eq("id", a_id)` call for each ID.
**Action:** Use `.in_("id", batch)` to batch updates instead of `.eq("id", id)` inside a loop. Make sure to batch the `.in_()` call in chunks of 100 to avoid PostgREST URL length limits if the payload is large.
## 2026-04-16 - [Supabase REST API Exact Count Overheads]
**Learning:** Raw PostgREST API requests (via `requests.get`) utilizing the `Prefer: count=exact` header for computing row counts default to returning all matching rows if `limit` is not specified. This leads to an O(N) memory and network download overhead.
**Action:** Always append `&limit=1` to the URL parameters (e.g. `?select=id&limit=1`) when querying the PostgREST API strictly for the exact count, to minimize the payload to at most a single row while still acquiring the total count via the `Content-Range` header.
